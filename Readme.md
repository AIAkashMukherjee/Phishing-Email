# PHISHING EMAIL DATASET

This dataset was compiled by researchers to study phishing email tactics. It combines emails from a variety of sources to create a comprehensive resource for analysis.

## Initial Datasets:

* **Enron and Ling Datasets:** These datasets focus on the core content of phishing emails, containing subject lines, email body text, and labels indicating whether the email is spam (phishing) or legitimate.
* **CEAS, Nazario, Nigerian Fraud, and SpamAssassin Datasets:** These datasets provide broader context for the emails, including sender information, recipient information, date, and labels for spam/legitimate classification.

## Final Dataset:

The final dataset combines the information from the initial datasets into a single resource for analysis. This dataset contains:

* Approximately 82,500 emails
* 42,891 spam emails
* 39,595 legitimate emails
